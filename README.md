Experiment 6: Implementation of Looping and Control Structures in C++**

Aim : To implement various control structures like for loop, while loop, and break statement in C++ through simple programs.

Theory : Control structures in C++ help in controlling the flow of program execution. In this experiment, we focus on three basic constructs: for loop, while loop, and break statement.

For Loop : A for loop is a control structure used to execute a block of code a fixed number of times. It is commonly used when the number of iterations is known in advance.
Syntax:

for(initialization; condition; update){

}

While Loop : A while loop is used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as the given condition remains true. It is generally used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand.
Syntax:

while(condition) { // code to be executed }

Break Statement : The break statement is used to exit a loop immediately, regardless of the loopâ€™s condition. It is often used when a specific condition is met and continuing the loop is no longer necessary.
Syntax:

break;

Tools Required:

C++ Compiler (programiz)
Conclusion:

In this experiment, I understood how to use loop structures like for and while, and how the break statement can be used to exit loops when required. These control structures are fundamental in creating logical, repetitive, and decision-driven programs in C++.
